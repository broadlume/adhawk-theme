# AdHawk Theme

This is a repository for developing the AdHawk base Bootstrap theme.

## Developing

First install the dependencies:
 - `npm install`

Then, you can start the server:
 - `npm start`

Finally, begin editing the files `variables.scss` and `adhawk.scss` and watch
the magic unfold.

## Easy demoing on any site

It is possible to inject CSS into any site and see the outcome. I suggest using the [CSS Inject](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/css-inject/fmiohbdblcemacakpnoinjmcelddpjbg) Chrome extension.

1) Set the URL for the CSS to inject to `http://local.tryadhawk.com:3030/css/theme.css`
2) ?
3) Profit

You can now see how the AdHawk theme would look on any page which uses Bootstrap.
